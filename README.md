# Project 2 Data Mining
The second project in the course Data Mining offered by the National Kapodistrian University of Athens in the academic year 2020-2021


# Fake News Detection

This repository contains the code and data for a data mining project on fake news detection. The objective of the project is to use data mining techniques to distinguish between real and fake news articles.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets, `fake.csv` and `true.csv`, which contain news articles labeled as either fake or real. The datasets were provided as part of the data mining course and were not obtained from any external source.

## Approach

The project involved several data mining techniques such as data exploration, text preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms to identify fake news. 

The data exploration process involved analyzing the datasets, understanding their structure, and identifying any patterns or anomalies in the data.

The text preprocessing step involved cleaning the text data by removing stop words, stemming, and converting text to numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF.

The feature selection step involved selecting relevant features from the text data using techniques such as chi-squared test and mutual information gain.

Finally, we trained and evaluated various classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict whether a given news article is fake or real.

## Code

The code for the project is contained in a Jupyter notebook called `Project2_DataMining.ipynb`. The notebook walks through the entire process of data exploration, text preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. It uses various libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and nltk.

To run the code, you can use platforms that support `.ipynb` files such as Google Colab or Kaggle. You can upload the notebook to the platform and run each cell in sequence.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the potential of data mining techniques to distinguish between real and fake news articles with high accuracy.
